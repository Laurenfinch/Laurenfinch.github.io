                <p>
                    Gardeners need an easy way to keep track of when to water the plants in their garden in order to ensure healthy plants that yield fruits or vegetables. Some plants require different amounts of water at different intervals in order to produce the most yield, and knowing these discrepancies and monitoring them will ensure healthier plants.
